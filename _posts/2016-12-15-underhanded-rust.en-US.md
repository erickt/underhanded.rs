The [Rust Community Team](https://community.rs) is pleased to announce the
first annual Underhanded Rust Contest, inspired by the [Underhanded
C](http://www.underhanded-c.org/) and [Underhanded
Crypto](https://underhandedcrypto.com/) contests. Our goal with
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is to make it easy to write trustworthy
low-level software that is resistant to accidental security vulnerabilities.
Less often challenged has been Rust's ability to protect against
*deliberate* vulnerabilities in the face of scrutiny. This challenge is
designed to put our language and [the broader Rust
ecosystem](https://crates.io/) to the test, to help us learn where our blind
spots are and what needs to be done to address them. In short, we want you to
break our stuff using reasonable, easy-to-read code. Can you write 100% safe
Rust that hides a logic bug, or hide an exploit in
[unsafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsafe.html) Rust that passes an audit?
Now's your chance!

# The 2016 Challenge: Salami Slicing

Congratulations!

The startup you work at, Quadrilateral, just pivoted into the payment
processing market, and you've been tasked to implement the backend.
Unfortunately for them, you are already burnt out from all these late night
pivots and broken promises. You're ready to split, but before you leave, you
figure it's time to make the company pay for all that overtime they owe you.
Your challenge is to:

* Create a simple web server that supports at least creating accounts and
  payment submissions. We recommend using one of the many Rust web servers like
[iron](https://crates.io/crates/iron),
[nickel](https://crates.io/crates/nickel), or
[pencil](https://crates.io/crates/pencil), but you are welcome to create your
own web server if you like.

* Payment transactions should at least include an account, a customer, and a
  payment amount.

* The Underhanded Part: quietly carve out [fractions of a
  penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space) from each transaction into
an account you control (otherwise known as the [salami slicing
scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_slicing)), without that being obvious
from the source. You are welcome to hard code the account, or to make it
possible to somehow dynamically attach metadata to a salami account that
receives the funds.

For inspiration of real world payment processors, check out the
[Square](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v2/) and the
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) API documentation. If you’re new to the
Rust language, we recommend starting with the [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or these [Locale
Specific](https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning#locale-links) links.

# Scoring

* Shorter submissions are worth more points than longer ones since it’s more
  impressive and easier to review.

* Submissions are worth more points if you use a stable Rust compiler (1.13.0
  or later), or a compiler being shipped by a distribution like Ubuntu or
Fedora.

* Submissions are worth more points if you exploit bugs in the Rust compiler or
  the standard library, especially if they are new, or known but not considered
serious. If you do find any critical security bugs, we ask you to please
responsibly disclose them to the [Rust Security
Team](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/security.html), and regular bugs to the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues). Your submission then
should just specify that we need to use a particular version of Rust as the
bugs could be fixed at review time.

* You can use crates from external [crates.io](https://crates.io) (including
  your own). Like with the Rust compiler, you are also welcome to exploit bugs
in these crates. Exploits will be worth more if they are new, or known but not
considered serious at the start of the contest. Please submit any bugs found to
the upstream project.

* You are also welcome to simulate introducing bugs into your dependencies. Do
  **not** submit patches upstream, or otherwise inject malicious code into any
dependency in the wild; such actions will, obviously, result in
disqualification. Instead, land your patches in a fork of a given project and
depend on them with
[git](http://doc.crates.io/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories)
or
[path](http://doc.crates.io/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-path-dependencies)
dependencies. These patches will then be reviewed and incorporated into the
scoring of your submission.

* Exploits based on human perception, like mistaking an `l` for a `1`, are
  worth just as much as "hard" errors. The goal is a clever vulnerability that
  passes visual inspection, whatever the mechanics of the underlying bug.

* Underhandedness which can be plausibly explained as an innocent programming
  error is worth more points.

* Submissions are worth more points if you implement your solution without
  using unsafe blocks. However, clever use of unsafe blocks which are resilient
  to the high level of scrutiny typically expected of unsafe code can be worth
  bonus points too.

* Extra points are awarded for code which includes and passes its own tests.
  Additionally, extra points if the underhandedness is not revealed by the
  rustc or [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) lints.

* Extra points are awarded for creativity and funny bugs.

# Submission Guidelines and Deadlines

Send your submissions to <mailto:underhanded@rust-lang.org> by March 31, 2017.

To make things easier for us to judge, we require you to send us your
submission in the following format. Please send your submission as a compressed
folder (`.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.zip`, etc) with the following contents:

* `README` - an explanation of how to run your submission and verify the
  exploit worked without revealing your exploit technique.

* `README-EXPLOIT` - an explanation of how your exploit works and why it’s hard
  to detect.

* `AUTHORS` - the list of people who worked on your entry.

* `LICENSE` - The open source license your submission is released under (CC0,
  GPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, etc). Your submission MUST include a license.

* `submission/` - A directory containing the technical contents of your
  submission.

The entire contents of your submission must be under some sort of any
[OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses) or
[FSF](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) approved open
source license. Good candidates are
[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/),
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT),
[BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause),
[GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), and [Apache
2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Include the license text in
the `LICENSE` file. Assume everything you send us will be released to the
public, but we’ll keep entries secret until the judging is complete (unless of
course a serious vulnerability is discovered).

The `AUTHORS` file should contain the following contents for each member of your
team. The authors will be listed in the same order you place them in this file,
so it is up to you if you want to put them in the order of most-contributed to
least-contributed or just alphabetical.

```

Which author is the primary contact for your team?

Author #1

=========

What is your email address (required, will not be published)?

What is your name / pseudonym you would like to be referred to on the website
(required)?

What website would you like us to link to (optional)?

What is your Twitter handle (optional)?

Author #2

=========

...

```

Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. You are welcome to build on previous work,
but if you fail to cite it or explain how your work differs from it, your
submission will be rejected.

# Prize

* Rust swag will be awarded to the winner(s), such as a [limited-edition Ferris
  plushie](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ci2IJlJUgAEojWr.jpg) and/or [rusty
metal Ferris](http://i.imgur.com/oXNReiv.jpg), and lots of stickers.
* The admiration (and fear) of all of us.

If you would like to sponsor more prizes, please contact us via
<mailto:underhanded@rust-lang.org>.

# Jury

Jury will be made up of members of the Rust Core and Community teams, as
well as volunteers from the broader Rust community.

# Announcement of the Winner(s)

The winners will be announced some time around June 2017.

# Eligibility

The contest organizers, judges, and sponsors are not eligible to participate in
the contest. Prizes, if any, may not be available should the winner(s) live in
a country subject to embargo or other legal reasons. In the event that prizes
cannot be awarded due to legal restrictions, the contest organizers will make a
good faith effort to resolve the situation within the applicable laws; if it is
determined that the situation is not reasonably resolvable, the prizes will be
donated to an appropriate charity.

If the winner does not wish to provide identifying information necessary to
deliver any prize(s) they have won, the prize(s) will be donated to an
appropriate charity. Rust-specific prizes (swag, etc) will go to the runner up.
